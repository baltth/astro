Just two days after [sketching these](aristarchus-herodotus-2025-09-04.md)
I checked them again. I was fascinated by the difference
and decided to sketch them again using the same perspective.

Now it's as bright as it can be. Aristarchus had lost its contour and looks
bigger as it's 'merged' with the surrounding light surface.
