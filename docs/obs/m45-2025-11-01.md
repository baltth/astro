_M45_ -- _Pleiades_ -- _Open cluster in Taurus_  

![Messier 45](../img/m45-20251103.jpg)

Something new... the first double-stack sketch. As 1.1° is my
largest FOV, Pleiades fits perfectly into the overlapping circles.
I've created this as an experiment, but the result is pretty.
I'm sure I'll repeat this under good skies.
