Dumbbell Nebula is a favorite -
this was my first deep space object,
observed about eight years ago.
This night it looked really well,
just as bright to perfectly show its contour.
Sometimes it has a shape like a brick but not today.

> This night was exceptionally clear, NELM was rather 4.7.
> I was experimenting with using black and blue pens for annotations.
