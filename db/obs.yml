      A favorite since the first view.

      This was the first sketch using the 'double circle' format
      on a B5 notepad. It looked so fascinating that I've done
      two sketches with different magnification, check
      the link below.

      Saturn Nebula looked extremely well on this night.
      The color and intensity of the sketch is exaggerated.
      Maybe this shows my impression of this beautiful nebula,
      or simply caused by my lack of experience.

      While it seems simple, this star system has a complex
      [hierarchy](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gamma_Andromedae_Components_Black.svg).
      Unfortunately only the main component can be resolved separately.

      Saturn and Titan for the first time...

      It was a challenge to sketch the planet in this small size.

      This star system looks much prettier than my sketch. The main component is a double star
      on its own but it's impossible to resolve with telescope.
      It's also a variable star with _UU Psc_ designation.

      Unfortunately there's no visible neighbor in this field of view.

      Pi-1 and Pi-2 Pegasi are unrelated and too far (10') to

      My first sketch of the Moon. I didn't prepare this, just simply had

      Just two days after [sketching these](aristarchus-herodotus-2025-09-04.md)
      I checked them again. I was fascinated by the difference
      and decided to sketch them again using the same perspective.

      Now it's as bright as it can be. Aristarchus had lost its contour and looks
      bigger as it's 'merged' with the surrounding light surface.

      It's a really nice shiny blueish pair. Everything beyond
      the visuals is confusing.
      By [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Arietis)
      it's a 'binary _or possibly_ trinary star system.'
      Its primary _A_ component is called _γ-2,_ while
      the secondary _B_ is _γ-1._ γ-2 is considered as an
      A2-class subgiant but it maybe has a red dwarf pair.
      Why not?

      Even the catalogue IDs are contradicting. Wikipedia states that
      - A = γ-2 = HD 11503 = HR _546_ = _Mesarthim_
      - B = γ-1 = HD _11502_ = HR 545

      while astronomyapi.com data is
      - HD _11502_ = HR _546_ = _Mesarthim_
      - no data for HD 11503 nor HR 545

      Spectral classes on Wikipedia:
      - A: A2IVpSiSrCr
      - B: A0Vnp λ Boo _or_ A0IV-V(n)kB8

      On astronomyapi.com HD 11502 is A1p Si.
      By the way, what is _A0IV-V(n)kB8?_ And what is
      'chemically peculiar'?...

      I also failed to measure the separation correctly.
      The result is definitely wrong, about the double of
      the real value. I have to check my method and measure
      it again later.

      I've done this sketch as an experiment on a cloudy night.
      The sky was covered by a thin but even layer of cirrocumulus,
      I was able to observe details only for a few minutes.
      It was fun in the end and the result is not so bad.

      I had really short time to observe this comet and finished the sketch
      just at the end of dusk. Apart from this, this was a remarkable night,
      Szarvas seems to be a really good location for observations.

      These stars are part of the Hyades, forming an asterism like a
      [Penrose triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle).
      Unfortunately the FOV is a bit small, visually it's more spectacular
      and the group is easy to identify.

      I've found no reference about this 'asterism' yet, so I named it
      by my first association:

      ![Penrose annotated](../img/penrose-annotated-20251103.png)

      Members of the group:
      - Theta-1 Tau (4.0 mag)
      - Theta-2 Tau (3.5 mag)
      - 80 Tau (5.6 mag)
      - 81 Tau (5.5 mag)
      - HD 28568 (6.6 mag)
      - HD 28527 (4.8 mag)

      Something new... the first double-stack sketch. As 1.1° is my
      largest FOV, Pleiades fits perfectly into the overlapping circles.
      I've created this as an experiment, but the result is pretty.
      I'm sure I'll repeat this under good skies.
