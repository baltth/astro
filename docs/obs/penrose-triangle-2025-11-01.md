_Penrose triangle_ -- _Asterism in Taurus_  

![Penrose triangle](../img/penrose-triangle-20251103.jpg)

These stars are part of the Hyades, forming an asterism like a
[Penrose triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle).
Unfortunately the FOV is a bit small, visually it's more spectacular
and the group is easy to identify.

I've found no reference about this 'asterism' yet, so I named it
by my first association:
