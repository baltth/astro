_Gamma Ari_ -- _γ Ari_ -- _Mesarthim_ -- _Star system in Aries_  

![Gamma Arietis](../img/gamma-ari-20250916.jpg)

It's a really nice shiny blueish pair. Everything beyond
the visuals is confusing.
By [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Arietis)
it's a 'binary _or possibly_ trinary star system.'
Its primary _A_ component is called _γ-2,_ while
the secondary _B_ is _γ-1._ γ-2 is considered as an
A2-class subgiant but it maybe has a red dwarf pair.
Why not?

Even the catalogue IDs are contradicting. Wikipedia states that
- A = γ-2 = HD 11503 = HR _546_ = _Mesarthim_
- B = γ-1 = HD _11502_ = HR 545

while astronomyapi.com data is
- HD _11502_ = HR _546_ = _Mesarthim_
- no data for HD 11503 nor HR 545

Spectral classes on Wikipedia:
- A: A2IVpSiSrCr
- B: A0Vnp λ Boo _or_ A0IV-V(n)kB8

On astronomyapi.com HD 11502 is A1p Si.
By the way, what is _A0IV-V(n)kB8?_ And what is
'chemically peculiar'?...

I also failed to measure the separation correctly.
The result is definitely wrong, about the double of
the real value. I have to check my method and measure
it again later.
