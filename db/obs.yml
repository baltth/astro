      A favorite since the first view.

      This was the first sketch using the 'double circle' format
      on a B5 notepad. It looked so fascinating that I've done
      two sketches with different magnification, check
      the link below.

      Oops, it's a typo, 'V Aqu' is written there. Apart from this,
      I really like this star and its neighborhood.

      Saturn Nebula looked extremely well on this night.
      The color and intensity of the sketch is exaggerated.
      Maybe this shows my impression of this beautiful nebula,
      or simply caused by my lack of experience.

      Dedicated to my dear wife, Klári.

      My ζ 'zeta' looks like a ξ 'xi' here, sorry for that.
      I'm sure I'll make another sketch of this trio some day.

      This star system is really worth to see.
      Maybe the colors of the sketch are too intensive,
      I was experimenting with different pencils.

      Saturn and Titan for the first time...
      The rings look flat now but still have visible shadow.

      It was a challenge to sketch the planet in this small size.
      I used no blending, thus the texture is my fault.

      This sketch was a challenge.
      I've tried to interpret the proper relative brightness
      of the stars but the result lacks the real shine of
      the main ones.

      The Ring could be seen really well today.
      It was really hard to determine the orientation
      of its elliptic shape, just as if it were swapping
      directions based on my view.

      Dumbbell Nebula is a favorite -
      this was my first deep space object,
      observed about eight years ago.
      This night it looked really well,
      just as bright to perfectly show its contour.
      Sometimes it has a shape like a brick but not today.

      Really nice binary. This was my fourth sketch on that night.
      I was tired, the surroundings may be rough and incomplete.

      This star system looks much prettier than my sketch. The main component is a double star
      on its own but it's impossible to resolve with telescope.
      It's also a variable star with _UU Psc_ designation.
      
      Unfortunately there's no visible neighbor in this field of view.
