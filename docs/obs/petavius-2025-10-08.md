_Petavius_ -- _Crater in Moon_  

![Petavius](../img/petavius-20251009.jpg)

I've done this sketch as an experiment on a cloudy night.
The sky was covered by a thin but even layer of cirrocumulus,
I was able to observe details only for a few minutes.
It was fun in the end and the result is not so bad.
