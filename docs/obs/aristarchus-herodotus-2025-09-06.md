Just two days after [sketching these](aristarchus-herodotus-2025-09-04.md)
I checked them again to start the night. I was fascinated by the difference
and decided to a sketch again with the same perspective.

Now it's as bright as it can be. Aristarchus had lost its contour and looks
bigger as it's 'merged' with the surrounding light surface.
