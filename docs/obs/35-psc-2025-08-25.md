_35 Psc_ -- _UU Piscium_ -- _Triple star in Pisces_  

![35 Piscium](../img/35-psc-20250826.jpg)

This star system looks much prettier than my sketch. The main component is a double star
on its own but it's impossible to resolve with telescope.
It's also a variable star with _UU Psc_ designation.

Unfortunately there's no visible neighbor in this field of view.
